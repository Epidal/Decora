## What is Decora?
Decora is a visual UI editor for CABAL Online. It allows you to redesign the entire user interface using intuitive controls. It also supports all known Western UI formats (EP2 through EP5, Asian clients not supported).

## How do I use Decora?
Start by clicking the left-most button in the toolbar and selecting your ui.dat.

Then, select the desired scene from the drop-down list on the far right side of the toolbar.

The selected scene will now appear in the canvas area of the main window.

You can select a control in the scene by simply clicking on it. A golden border surrounds your current selection. If you move your mouse to the edges of the control, you can resize the control. You can also use your mouse to position the control. Do this by holding the left mouse button on the control, then dragging your mouse to the desired location.

Click the "Properties" tab on the right-hand side of the window. This will bring up a pane that contains information about the currently-selected control.

From here, you can tweak advanced properties of the scene's controls, or select a control from the "Controls" drop-down list. This is handy for those controls that don't have images, so aren't clickable with your mouse.

Click the "Texture List Editor" button in the toolbar on the main window. It is the third button from the left.

This window lets you change the names of the textures that are to be used for the UI. You can even add new textures here.

Click the "Image Bit Editor" button in the toolbar on the main window. It can be found next to the "Texture List Editor" button.

This window lets you change all the image sections that can be used as images for controls. You can add new "image bits" by clicking the "+" button next to the drop-down list on the right.

Click the "Text Editor" button in the toolbar on the main window. It is the right-most button.

## What does "Decora" mean?
It comes from the latin word "decore", meaning "beauty". It symbolises the desire to make things our own that most of us have, and to make those things look beautiful.
